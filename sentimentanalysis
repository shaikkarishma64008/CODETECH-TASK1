# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Sample text
texts = [
    "I love this new phone! The camera quality is amazing.",
    "The service at this restaurant was terrible. I'm never coming back.",
    "I went to the store today and bought some groceries."
]

# Initialize the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Analyze sentiment for each text
for text in texts:
    sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
    print()
