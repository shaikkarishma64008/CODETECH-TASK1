OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is indeed a fascinating and expansive field within AI. Here, I'll outline some key aspects of NLP, particularly focusing on sentiment analysis, and provide examples of outputs for better understanding.
1.	Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of text (like a tweet, review, or any other written content) is positive, negative, or neutral. This is useful in various applications like market analysis, customer feedback, and social media monitoring.
  Steps in Sentiment Analysis:
  	Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data.
  	Feature Extraction: Converting text into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models.
  	Model Training: Training a model on labeled data to recognize sentiment.
  	Prediction: Applying the trained model to new text data to predict sentiment.
  Example Outputs:
  Let's take some sample sentences and see how sentiment analysis might classify them.
  a)	Positive Sentiment:
  •	Input: "I love this new phone! The camera quality is amazing."
  •	Output: "Positive"
  b)	Negative Sentiment:
  •	Input: "The service at this restaurant was terrible. I'm never coming back."
  •	Output: "Negative"
  c)	Neutral Sentiment:
  •	Input: "I went to the store today and bought some groceries."
  •	Output: "Neutral"

Text Classification
Text Classification is the task of assigning predefined categories to text documents. It can be used for spam detection, topic labeling, or any task where text needs to be categorized into specific groups.
